### AfterLutz Administrator's Working Agreement

####Collaboration
The long-term health of the AfterLutz organization is dependant on the collaboration of a number of interested participants. Regular communication by way of the group's Discord channel, or by participation in issues opened in the project's repositories is important in keeping the Akkatecture, the core repository, healthy and relevant. Additionally, have a standard process by which changes are accepted into projects is necessary to keep as much participation as possible.

####Pull Requests From Outside Contributors 

When pull requests are received from contributors not having read/commit privileges, they will require approval and merging by an administrator. After commenting on and approving the pull request, the administrator should wait no less than one week before merging that request. This will allow other administrators to weigh in and give any other feedback.

####Pull Requests From Administrators 

Similar to those PRs from outside contributors, administrators who have created a pull request should wait no less than one week before self-approving and merging it. This will allow a discussion to develop around the quality the changes being introduced.

####Discussions on Technical Direction
It is hoped that administrators will participate in discussions regarding the technical direction of Akkatecture, and other projects owned by AfterLutz. Given active community of professional developers providing their inputs, the organization can thrive.
