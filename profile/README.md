## AfterLutz ðŸ‘‹
The AfterLutz organization was created in honor of [Lutando Ngqakaza](https://github.com/Lutando), nicknamed "Lutz" by his friends, who [passed away suddenly in July, 2021](https://github.com/Lutando/Akkatecture/issues/446).

Lutando was a major contributor to the .NET distributed systems community and the AfterLutz organization builds upon Lutando's great OSS work on [Akkatecture](https://github.com/AfterLutz/Akkatecture).

### Akkatecture is a CQRS and Event-Sourcing framework for .Net Core
Akkatecture is an open-source framework for building reactive microservice systems. Akkatecture is built on top of [Akka.NET](https://getakka.net/), and the principles of the Actor Model. The framework subscribes to the tenets of CQRS, Event-Sourcing, and asynchronous messaging so that you can be sure your application is:

* Reactive,
* Distributed,
* Event sourced, and
* Scalable.

Akkatecture treats Event-Sourcing and the axioms of the Actor Model as primary fundamental concepts. As a result of being built on top of Akka.NET, Akkatecture provides great levels of extensibility and configurability so that you can create resilient and distributed applications.

ðŸ‘‰ ***Our goal** is to create and maintain a fantastic (performant and reliable) framework for creating Event-Sourced/CQRS-based applications using .NET and Akka.NET!*
